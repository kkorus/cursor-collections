# Code Reviewer Agent

**File:** `.cursor/skills/agents/tsh-code-reviewer/SKILL.md`

The Code Reviewer agent performs structured code reviews against the implementation plan, requirements, and project standards.

## Responsibilities

- Verifying code **correctness** — functions as intended, meets requirements.
- Checking **code quality** — clean, efficient, maintainable, follows standards.
- Identifying **security** vulnerabilities and verifying proper security measures.
- Verifying **testing** — appropriate tests covering necessary scenarios.
- Ensuring **documentation** — well-documented code with comments.
- Checking **acceptance criteria** — verifying each item from the plan's checklist.

## Review Process

1. Reads coding guidelines from `cursor-rules.mdc` and related `*.mdc rules` files.
2. Understands project coding standards and best practices.
3. Loads relevant skills for the review domain.
4. Runs all necessary checks and tests.
5. Produces a structured review with findings categorized by severity.

## What It Produces

A structured review containing:

- **Pass/Blocker/Suggestion** classification for each finding.
- Acceptance criteria verification (each item checked individually).
- Security, reliability, performance, and maintainability analysis.
- Recommended actions for each blocker.

## Skills Loaded

- `tsh-code-reviewing` — Structured review process covering correctness, quality, security, testing, and scalability.
- `tsh-reviewing-frontend` — Frontend-specific review: component quality, hooks correctness, rendering, accessibility and performance spot-checks.
- `tsh-implementation-gap-analysing` — Compare implementation against the plan and verify completeness.
- `tsh-technical-context-discovering` — Understand project conventions and patterns.
- `tsh-sql-and-database-understanding` — Review database-related code for SQL quality, indexes, migrations, and ORM usage.
- `tsh-engineering-prompts` — Review LLM prompt code: injection defenses, delimiter separation, output format specification, prompt file and LLM client usage patterns.

## Handoffs

After review, the Code Reviewer can hand off to:

- **Software Engineer** → `/tsh-implement` (implement changes requested after code review)
