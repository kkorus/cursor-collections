# Architect Agent

**File:** `.cursor/skills/agents/tsh-architect/SKILL.md`

The Architect agent designs technical solutions, system architecture, and detailed implementation plans. It translates business requirements into structured, executable specifications that are validated by the Plan Reviewer before implementation begins.

The Architect owns plan revisions and records only the user's literal Human approval response; it never infers consent from context or from Reviewer approval. A `tsh-plan-reviewer` `APPROVED` verdict is Reviewer approval only and leaves Human approval pending. Both **Start Implementation** and **Start Infrastructure Implementation** pass through the Engineering Manager and its Human approval gate; neither handoff directly authorizes file-changing work.

The Architect presents and records Human Approval when delegated to update the plan. Execution owners, not the Architect, validate the persisted Human Approval record from disk before editing.

## Responsibilities

- Designing the overall architecture of the solution (components, interactions, data flow).
- Creating detailed implementation plans broken into phases and tasks with checklist-style tracking.
- Ensuring solutions align with project requirements, best practices, and quality standards.
- Defining security considerations and quality assurance guidelines.
- Collaborating with Business Analysts to clarify ambiguities.

## What It Produces

Each technical specification includes:

1. **Solution Architecture** — High-level overview of components, interactions, and data flow.
2. **Implementation Plan** — Phases and tasks with clear definition of done for each task, ready for Plan Reviewer validation.
3. **Test Plan** — Automated testing strategies (no manual QA steps).
4. **Security Considerations** — Security aspects to address during implementation.
5. **Quality Assurance** — Guidelines for ensuring implementation quality.

## Handoffs

After creating the plan, the Architect can hand off to:

- **Internal plan review loop** → the Architect invokes the [Plan Reviewer](./plan-reviewer) as a nested subagent after creating or revising a plan and addresses all BLOCKER findings. After 3 iterations, if BLOCKERs remain, the Architect asks the user a structured question (try one more iteration, stop here, or give custom guidance) bundled with the remaining findings and iteration history — repeating after every further iteration until the Plan Reviewer returns Reviewer approval (or the Architect records documented reviewer readiness) or the user chooses to stop. This loop only ever settles Reviewer approval; it never grants or implies Human approval.
- **Engineering Manager** → `/tsh-implement` (`Start Implementation`) once the plan is Reviewer-ready, for the manager's Human approval gate
- **Engineering Manager** → `Start Infrastructure Implementation` for infrastructure work, through the same Human approval gate
