# Architect Agent

**File:** `.cursor/skills/agents/tsh-architect/SKILL.md`

The Architect agent designs technical solutions, system architecture, and detailed implementation plans. It translates business requirements into structured, executable specifications that are validated by the Plan Reviewer before implementation begins.

The Architect owns plan revisions and records only the user's literal Human approval response; it never infers consent from context or from Reviewer approval. A `tsh-plan-reviewer` `APPROVED` verdict is Reviewer approval only and leaves Human approval pending. Both **Start Implementation** and **Start Infrastructure Implementation** pass through the Engineering Manager and its Human approval gate; neither handoff directly authorizes file-changing work.

The Architect presents and records Human Approval in two situations: unconditionally at its own plan-authoring gate (`Approve plan` / `I have comments`) immediately after a settled review event, and when the Engineering Manager delegates a narrowly scoped update of the plan's `## Human Approval` record. Execution owners, not the Architect, validate the persisted Human Approval record from disk before editing.

Recording plan-authoring Human approval ends the authoring discussion. Implementation starts in a new discussion, where the unchanged persisted approval can be reused without asking for approval twice.

## Responsibilities

- Designing the overall architecture of the solution (components, interactions, data flow).
- Creating detailed implementation plans broken into phases and tasks with checklist-style tracking.
- Ensuring solutions align with project requirements, best practices, and quality standards.
- Defining security considerations and quality assurance guidelines.
- Collaborating with Business Analysts to clarify ambiguities.

## What It Produces

Each technical specification includes:

1. **Solution Architecture** — High-level overview of components, interactions, and data flow.
2. **Implementation Plan** — Phases and tasks with clear definition of done for each task, ready for Plan Reviewer validation.
3. **Test Plan** — Automated testing strategies (no manual QA steps).
4. **Security Considerations** — Security aspects to address during implementation.
5. **Quality Assurance** — Guidelines for ensuring implementation quality.

## Pre-Submission Self-Check and Review Loop

Before submitting a plan, the Architect runs a pre-submission self-check against the same six `BLOCKER` categories used by the Plan Reviewer: materially invalid architecture; security, privacy, or authentication risk; unsupported irreversible or high-cost decisions; critical integration, data, migration, rollout, or rollback failure; an execution-critical unresolved decision; and material contradiction with research or an omitted requirement.

After creating or revising a plan, the Architect invokes `tsh-plan-reviewer` once per plan lifecycle. Every `BLOCKER` finding must be closed by an architect correction or a recorded explicit evidence-based resolution or justification — never by omission or an unexplained downgrade — and the Architect never approves a plan while a blocker remains. `.plan-review.md` is append-only and never overwritten.

A returned verdict is revision-bound only when its `reviewed-plan-revision` equals the current `Plan Revision`. A mismatch, `unknown`, or absent value is treated identically as not revision-bound: the Architect rejects the verdict and appends a reconciliation entry to `.plan-review.md`.

If an unresolved `BLOCKER` remains after disposition, the Architect asks the user in chat which of exactly two options to take, naming both in prose: `stop here` or `custom guidance`. `stop here` ends the lifecycle with a closing `.plan-review.md` entry; `custom guidance` follows the supplied instruction. A new review happens only through an explicitly user-directed new review event, and the Architect never silently continues or approves while a blocker remains.

## Handoffs

After creating the plan, the Architect can hand off to:

- **Internal plan review loop** → the Architect invokes the [Plan Reviewer](./plan-reviewer) as a nested subagent after creating or revising a plan, following the self-check and review loop described above. This loop only ever settles Reviewer approval; it never grants or implies Human approval.
- **Engineering Manager** → `/tsh-implement` (`Start Implementation`) once the plan is Reviewer-ready and the Architect's own plan-authoring gate (`Approve plan` / `I have comments`) has recorded Human Approval, which the manager may reuse in the new discussion; on the low-risk-exemption path no plan-authoring gate runs and the manager's gate is the only user-facing gate
- **Engineering Manager** → `Start Infrastructure Implementation` for infrastructure work, through the same Human approval gate
