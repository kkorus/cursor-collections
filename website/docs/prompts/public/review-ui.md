# /tsh-review-ui

**Agent:** UI Reviewer  
**File:** `.cursor/skills/commands/tsh-review-ui/SKILL.md`

Performs a single-pass, read-only verification comparing the implemented UI against the Figma design.

## Usage

Called automatically by `/tsh-implement` (via the internal UI prompt) in a verification loop. Can also be invoked manually:

```text
/tsh-review-ui <component or page description>
```

## What It Does

1. **Validates inputs** — Ensures Figma URL is available and dev server is running.
2. **Gets EXPECTED** — Calls Figma MCP to extract design specifications (layer hierarchy, layout, spacing, typography, colors, dimensions).
3. **Gets ACTUAL** — Uses Playwright MCP to capture the running app (scrolls through entire page, captures accessibility tree).
4. **Compares** — Follows `tsh-ui-verifying` skill criteria: structure FIRST, then dimensions, then visual.
5. **Reports** — Generates a structured PASS/FAIL report with difference table.

## Skills Loaded

- `tsh-ui-verifying` — Verification criteria, structure checklist, severity definitions, tolerances.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Verification Result: [PASS | FAIL]

### Component: [name]

**Confidence:** [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]

### Structural Issues (CRITICAL)

| Issue | Expected (Figma) | Actual (Implementation) |

### Dimension/Visual Differences

| Property | Expected (Figma) | Actual (Implementation) | Severity |

### Recommended Fixes

- [specific fix with exact values]
```

## Key Rules

- **Read-only** — Does not modify code. Only reports differences.
- **Both tools required** — Uses Figma MCP (EXPECTED) and Playwright MCP (ACTUAL).
- **Structure mismatches = automatic FAIL** — Layout/hierarchy issues are never ignored.
- **1-2px tolerance** — Only for browser rendering variance, not for structure/layout.
- **Reports differences per verification order** — Structure, layout, dimensions, visual — stops on first CRITICAL failure as defined by the skill.

## Confidence Levels

| Level      | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HIGH**   | Both tools returned complete data; comparison is reliable     |
| **MEDIUM** | Some values could not be extracted; manual review recommended |
| **LOW**    | Tool errors occurred; treat as incomplete verification        |
