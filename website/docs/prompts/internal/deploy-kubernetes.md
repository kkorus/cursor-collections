# tsh-deploy-kubernetes (internal)

:::info
Not invoked directly by users. To trigger Kubernetes deployments, use [`/tsh-implement`](../public/implement) — the [Engineering Manager](../../agents/engineering-manager) will automatically delegate to the [DevOps Engineer](../../agents/devops-engineer).
:::

**Agent:** DevOps Engineer
**File:** `.cursor/skills/internal/tsh-deploy-kubernetes/SKILL.md`

Creates Kubernetes deployments, Helm charts, and configures workload resources following production-ready patterns.

## How It’s Triggered

```text
/tsh-implement <describe what to deploy or modify in Kubernetes>
```

The Engineering Manager identifies Kubernetes tasks in the plan and delegates them to the DevOps Engineer automatically.

## What It Does

### 1. Context Discovery

- Identifies existing Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and Kustomize overlays.
- Checks for project-specific infrastructure instructions.
- Discovers existing deployment patterns, naming conventions, and namespace structure.

### 2. Implementation

- Creates deployments with proper health probes, resource limits, and scaling policies.
- Generates Helm charts with values files for multi-environment support.
- Configures secrets handling, ConfigMaps, and service accounts.
- Implements network policies and security configurations.

### 3. Safety Checks

- Validates manifests before applying.
- Prefers `--dry-run` for initial verification.
- Includes rollback strategies and deployment safeguards.

## Skills Loaded

- `tsh-managing-secrets` — Secrets management for Kubernetes environments.
- `tsh-technical-context-discovering` — Project conventions and existing patterns.
