## Product Managers & Business Analysts

### 1. Converting Workshop Materials into a Jira Backlog

**When:** Your team just finished a discovery workshop. You have a raw transcript, Figma boards, and scattered notes — and you need to turn them into a structured, prioritized Jira backlog before the next sprint planning.

**The old way:** Manually re-read the transcript, extract action items into a spreadsheet, copy-paste into Jira one by one, miss half the edge cases, and spend the next grooming session fixing vague stories.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-explore-materials <paste transcript or attach materials>   # optional
/tsh-analyze-materials <paste transcript or attach materials>
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Explore Mode (optional)** | The Business Analyst can first produce `workshop-context-summary.md` when the materials are still ambiguous and you want to validate likely scope before extraction. |
| **2. Transcript processing & analysis** | The raw transcript is cleaned, supporting materials are analyzed, and the existing codebase or backlog baseline is checked when relevant. |
| **3. Intent brief + Gate 0** | The agent drafts `intent-brief.md`. You review scope, exclusions, and candidate epics before extraction begins. |
| **4. Task extraction + Gate 1** | Epics and user stories are identified with business-oriented descriptions, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and source traceability. You review the breakdown before it proceeds. |
| **5. Quality review** | The `tsh-task-quality-reviewing` skill automatically runs Lite or Full review. Full mode covers 10 analysis passes — entity lifecycle completeness, error states, notification gaps, third-party boundaries, platform operations, and more. |
| **6. Gate 1.5 — Accept/reject suggestions** | Each quality improvement is presented individually. You accept what makes sense and reject what doesn't apply. |
| **7. Jira formatting + Gate 2** | Tasks are formatted per the Jira benchmark template, then reviewed one final time before Jira sync. |
| **8. Jira sync verification** | After push, the agent reads the issues back, verifies the key fields, and refreshes the continuity baseline for future workshops. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-explore-materials` or `/tsh-analyze-materials` → Business Analyst  
**Key skills:** `tsh-transcript-processing`, `tsh-task-extracting`, `tsh-task-quality-reviewing`, `tsh-jira-task-formatting`, `tsh-codebase-analysing`

**Value:** A full discovery workshop is converted into a validated, Jira-ready backlog in a single session instead of days of manual work. The 10-pass quality review catches edge cases and gaps that manual extraction routinely misses — missing error states, notification gaps, incomplete entity lifecycles, and platform operations. Gate 0, Gate 1, Gate 1.5, and Gate 2 keep the backlog reviewable, and the verified Jira sync preserves continuity for later workshops.

### 2. Finding Gaps in Task Descriptions

**When:** You receive a Jira ticket with vague requirements, missing acceptance criteria, or conflicting information across Jira, Figma, and Confluence.

**The old way:** Start implementing with assumptions. Discover ambiguities halfway through. Go back to the PM. Lose half a sprint.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement PROJ-101
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Multi-source aggregation** | The Engineering Manager delegates to the Context Engineer, which pulls context from Jira, Confluence, Figma, and the codebase simultaneously via MCP integrations. |
| **2. Contradiction detection** | The `tsh-task-analysing` skill cross-references requirements across sources and flags inconsistencies, missing details, and ambiguous language. |
| **3. Open questions list** | The research document includes a structured list of open questions, assumptions that need validation, and risks — ready to send back to the PM. |
| **4. Scope validation** | The output highlights what’s covered by the ticket and what’s missing, so you can request clarification before writing a single line of code. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → Context Engineer  
**Key skills:** `tsh-task-analysing`, `tsh-codebase-analysing`

**Value:** Ambiguities are surfaced in minutes instead of days. The structured open questions list becomes a communication tool with PMs, reducing back-and-forth by 60–80%.

## Developers

### 3. Understanding How the Code Works

**When:** You pick up a ticket in an unfamiliar part of the codebase, inherit a legacy module, or need to trace a bug across multiple services.

**The old way:** Open dozens of files, grep for function names, read outdated Confluence pages, ask colleagues on Slack, and piece together a mental model over hours.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement PROJ-456
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Automatic context gathering** | The Engineering Manager delegates to the Context Engineer, which pulls requirements from Jira, related Confluence docs, and Figma designs via MCP integrations. |
| **2. Codebase analysis** | The `tsh-codebase-analysing` skill traces dependencies, identifies business logic patterns, and maps the data flow across layers. |
| **3. Structured output** | A `.research.md` document is generated with a task summary, identified components, assumptions, open questions, and risks. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → Context Engineer   The research document becomes a reusable artifact that helps the entire team — not just you.

### 4. Designing Architecture for a New Feature

**When:** You need to add a new module, design an API, restructure existing services, or plan a database migration.

**The old way:** Sketch something in a quick meeting, start coding, discover edge cases mid-sprint, refactor, repeat.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement PROJ-789
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Research phase** | The Engineering Manager delegates to the Context Engineer, which gathers all context — existing architecture, related features, constraints from Jira and Confluence. |
| **2. Architecture design** | The Engineering Manager delegates to the Architect, which creates a phased implementation plan with CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE labels for every task. |
| **3. Gap analysis** | The `tsh-architecture-designing` skill evaluates security considerations, scalability, and identifies risks before a single line of code is written. |
| **4. Database planning** | If the feature involves data changes, the `tsh-sql-and-database-understanding` skill provides schema design patterns, indexing strategies, and migration safety checks. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → Context Engineer + Architect  , reviewed, and agreed upon before implementation starts. Every task is clearly scoped with action labels (CREATE, MODIFY, REUSE), reducing mid-sprint surprises by 50–70%.

### 5. Delivering Pixel-Perfect Frontend

**When:** You're implementing a UI component from a Figma design and need it to match exactly — spacing, typography, colors, responsive behavior, and accessibility.

**The old way:** Eyeball the Figma spec, implement the component, get "doesn't match" feedback in design review, fix, re-submit, repeat 3–5 times.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement PROJ-321
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Figma extraction** | The agent reads exact design specs from Figma MCP — spacing values, color tokens, typography, component variants. |
| **2. Implementation** | Code is written following the `tsh-implementing-frontend` skill — semantic HTML, design system tokens, a11y patterns. |
| **3. Automated verification loop** | `/tsh-review-ui` is called automatically. `tsh-ui-capture-worker` collects Playwright CLI artifacts from the running app using the confirmed full URL, while Figma MCP provides expected values. A structured PASS/FAIL diff table is generated. |
| **4. Auto-fix cycle** | If FAIL, the agent fixes mismatches and re-verifies — up to 5 iterations — until the component passes or escalates. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → Software Engineer, `/tsh-review-ui` → UI Reviewer  
**Key skills:** `tsh-implementing-frontend`, `tsh-ui-verifying`, `tsh-technical-context-discovering`

**Setup note:** For this workflow, the app must already be running locally, you must confirm the exact full dev server URL, and `playwright-cli` must be available to the capture worker.

**Value:** Design-to-code accuracy reaches 95–99%. Design QA feedback rounds are reduced by 60–80%. Accessibility compliance is built in from the start, not bolted on after review.

---

### 6. Planning Database Changes Safely

**When:** You need to add tables, modify schemas, write complex queries, or plan a database migration with zero downtime.

**The old way:** Write the migration, run it in staging, hope nothing breaks. Discover missing indexes in production. ORM hides the N+1 query until load testing.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement PROJ-555
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Schema analysis** | The research phase identifies existing tables, relationships, and constraints affected by the change. |
| **2. Migration planning** | The Architect agent designs the migration with rollback strategies, following naming conventions and normalisation best practices. |
| **3. Query optimization** | The `tsh-sql-and-database-understanding` skill enforces `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, proper indexing, join optimization, and parameterized queries. |
| **4. ORM integration** | Supports TypeORM, Prisma, Doctrine, Eloquent, Entity Framework, Hibernate, and GORM — generating idiomatic code for your stack. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → Context Engineer + Architect + Software Engineer  
**Key skills:** `tsh-sql-and-database-understanding`, `tsh-architecture-designing`, `tsh-technical-context-discovering`

**Value:** Database performance issues are reduced by 40–60%. Migrations are planned with rollback strategies from the start. N+1 queries and missing indexes are caught during implementation, not in production.

## Tech Leads & Engineering Managers

### 7. Performing Thorough Code Reviews

**When:** You're reviewing a colleague's PR and want to go beyond surface-level "looks good to me" — checking for security, performance, correctness, and adherence to project standards.

**The old way:** Skim the diff, check for obvious bugs, approve. Miss the SQL injection, the missing error handling, and the N+1 query.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-review PROJ-789
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Multi-dimensional analysis** | The Code Reviewer agent checks acceptance criteria, security vulnerabilities, reliability, performance, maintainability, and coding standards. |
| **2. Security scanning** | Missing input validation, exposed secrets, improper error handling, and SQL injection vectors are flagged explicitly. |
| **3. Database review** | The `tsh-sql-and-database-understanding` skill checks for missing indexes, N+1 queries, improper locking, and migration safety. |
| **4. Structured verdict** | Findings are categorized as PASS, BLOCKER, or SUGGESTION — with clear explanations and remediation guidance. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-review` → Code Reviewer  
**Key skills:** `tsh-code-reviewing`, `tsh-sql-and-database-understanding`, `tsh-technical-context-discovering`

**Value:** Reviews are consistent, thorough, and documented. Security and performance issues are caught before production. Review cycle time is reduced by 30–50%.

---

### 8. Finding Implementation Gaps

**When:** You've finished coding a feature and want to verify that everything in the plan was actually implemented — no missed edge cases, no forgotten acceptance criteria.

**The old way:** Manually cross-reference the Jira ticket, the implementation plan, and your code changes. Hope you didn't miss anything. Find out during QA.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-review PROJ-456
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Plan-to-code comparison** | The Code Reviewer agent compares the implementation against the original plan, checking every phase and acceptance criterion. |
| **2. Gap detection** | The `tsh-implementation-gap-analysing` skill identifies what was planned but not implemented, what was implemented but not planned, and what was partially done. |
| **3. Structured findings** | A review report lists blockers (must fix), suggestions (should fix), and passes — with specific file and line references. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-review` → Code Reviewer  
**Key skills:** `tsh-implementation-gap-analysing`, `tsh-code-reviewing`, `tsh-technical-context-discovering`

**Value:** Rework cycles are reduced by 40–60%. Gaps are caught before QA, not during. Every review is structured and consistent, regardless of who performs it.

### 9. Cleaning Up Technical Debt

**When:** The codebase has accumulated dead code, duplicated logic, inconsistent patterns, and outdated dependencies. You need a systematic cleanup plan.

**The old way:** Nobody knows where the dead code is. Duplicate utilities are scattered across packages. "We'll clean it up later" never comes.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-review-codebase
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Full codebase scan** | The Architect agent runs parallel analysis across all layers — frontend, backend, shared libraries. |
| **2. Dead code detection** | Identifies unused imports, unreachable code paths, deprecated functions, and files not imported anywhere. |
| **3. Duplication mapping** | Finds duplicated functions, validation logic, UI components, and copy-pasted blocks that differ only in variable names. |
| **4. Improvement roadmap** | Generates a prioritized list of improvements — high cyclomatic complexity, SRP violations, excessive `any` types, missing error handling. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-review-codebase` → Architect  
**Key skills:** `tsh-codebase-analysing`, `tsh-technical-context-discovering`

**Value:** Technical debt becomes visible and quantifiable. Cleanup is prioritized by impact. Teams can tackle debt systematically with a clear roadmap instead of random ad-hoc fixes.

---

### 10. Onboarding New Team Members

**When:** You're joining a new team or project and need to become productive fast — understanding the tech stack, project conventions, architecture, and current state of the codebase.

**The old way:** Read a stale README, ask teammates for a walkthrough, spend the first week just getting oriented.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-review-codebase
# Then pick your first task:
/tsh-implement PROJ-001
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Codebase health snapshot** | `/tsh-review-codebase` gives you an immediate understanding of the codebase — its structure, patterns, tech stack, and quality issues. |
| **2. Convention discovery** | The `tsh-technical-context-discovering` skill identifies project conventions, coding standards, and established patterns — you learn how this team works. |
| **3. Guided first task** | `/tsh-implement` on your first ticket produces a structured research document and step-by-step implementation plan automatically, so you deliver with confidence. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-review-codebase` → Architect, `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → Context Engineer + Architect  
**Key skills:** `tsh-technical-context-discovering`, `tsh-codebase-analysing`, `tsh-architecture-designing`

**Value:** Onboarding time is reduced by 40–60%. New developers deliver their first meaningful PR days earlier. They absorb project conventions automatically instead of learning them through review feedback.

## QA Engineers

### 11. Increasing Test Coverage and Quality

**When:** You need to add E2E tests for a new feature, improve coverage for an existing flow, or fix flaky tests that the team no longer trusts.

**The old way:** Write tests with brittle CSS selectors, fight with timing issues, add `waitForTimeout` hacks, watch tests pass locally but fail in CI.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement Add E2E tests for the checkout flow in PROJ-654
```

:::tip
When the implementation plan contains E2E test tasks, the Engineering Manager automatically delegates them to the E2E Engineer agent. You don't need to invoke E2E testing separately — just use `/tsh-implement`.
:::

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Test scenario design** | The E2E Engineer agent analyzes the feature, maps acceptance criteria to test scenarios, and identifies critical user journeys. |
| **2. Page Object creation** | Reusable page abstractions are created with accessibility-first locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`). |
| **3. Test implementation** | Tests follow BDD-style Arrange-Act-Assert structure with dynamic test data (timestamps/UUIDs) — no shared state between tests. |
| **4. Stability verification** | Tests must pass **3+ consecutive times** in headless mode before being committed. Flaky detection is built into the verification loop. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager → E2E Engineer  
**Key skills:** `tsh-e2e-testing`, `tsh-technical-context-discovering`

**Value:** E2E test flakiness is reduced by 50–80%. Tests use proper auto-waiting assertions instead of arbitrary timeouts. Page Object patterns make tests maintainable and resistant to UI refactors.

## DevOps & SRE Engineers

### 12. Auditing Cloud Costs

**When:** Your cloud bill keeps growing and nobody knows exactly where the money is going. Unused resources, over-provisioned instances, and missing reserved instance commitments are likely costing thousands per month.

**The old way:** Export cost reports from the console, manually cross-reference with running resources, build spreadsheets, present them in a meeting, and then nothing changes.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-analyze-aws-costs us-east-1 everything
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. IaC analysis** | The DevOps Engineer agent scans Terraform and CloudFormation templates for over-provisioned resources, missing savings plan opportunities, and tagging gaps. |
| **2. Live infrastructure validation** | AWS API MCP queries actual resource usage — identifying orphaned EBS volumes, idle load balancers, and underutilized instances. |
| **3. Cost report** | A prioritized optimization report is generated with estimated monthly savings and specific CLI or Terraform changes for each recommendation. |

**Key prompts & agents:** `/tsh-analyze-aws-costs` or `/tsh-analyze-gcp-costs` → DevOps Engineer
**Key skills:** `tsh-optimizing-cloud-cost`

**Value:** Uncovers 20–40% potential cost savings. Tagging compliance gaps are identified for proper cost attribution. The hybrid approach (IaC + live API) catches both planned and untracked waste.

---

### 13. Provisioning Infrastructure Safely

**When:** You need to create new cloud resources, set up a Kubernetes cluster, configure a CI/CD pipeline, or implement monitoring — and you want to follow production-ready patterns from the start.

**The old way:** Copy Terraform from a blog post, skip cost estimation, realize the naming doesn't match your conventions, spend a day refactoring.

**With Cursor Collections:**

```text
/tsh-implement Create a VPC with public and private subnets for EKS
/tsh-implement Deploy the payment service with HPA and PDB
/tsh-implement Create GitHub Actions CI/CD for the monorepo
```

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Delegation** | The Engineering Manager reads the plan and delegates infrastructure tasks to the DevOps Engineer. |
| **2. Context discovery** | The DevOps Engineer discovers existing IaC patterns, naming conventions, tagging policies, and CI/CD platform. |
| **3. Implementation** | Infrastructure code is written following project conventions with proper naming, tagging, cost estimation, and safety guardrails. |
| **4. Safety checks** | `terraform plan`, `--dry-run`, or `validate` is run before any changes. Destructive operations require explicit authorization. |

**Key prompt:** `/tsh-implement` → Engineering Manager delegates to DevOps Engineer
**Key skills:** `tsh-implementing-terraform-modules`, `tsh-implementing-kubernetes`, `tsh-implementing-ci-cd`, `tsh-managing-secrets`

**Value:** Infrastructure follows production patterns from day one. Cost estimation is built into every proposal. Safety guardrails prevent accidental destruction. Reusable modules reduce duplication across projects.
