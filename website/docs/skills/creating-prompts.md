# Creating Prompts

**Folder:** `.cursor/skills/workflows/tsh-creating-prompts/`
**Used by:** Cursor Engineer

Provides templates, guidelines, and a structured process for building custom prompt files (`/SKILL.md`) that trigger specific workflows routed to the right custom agent and AI model.

## Core Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns** — A prompt file defines WHAT workflow to execute. It must NOT define WHO the agent is (agent territory) or embed reusable domain knowledge (skill territory).
- **Workflow focus** — A prompt routes work to a specific agent, targets a specific AI model, and describes workflow steps for a specific task.
- **Minimal duplication** — Prompts reference skills and agents; they don't duplicate their content.

## Prompt File Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **YAML Frontmatter** | `agent`, `model`, `description` fields |
| **Workflow Steps** | Ordered steps the agent should follow |
| **Input/Output** | What the prompt expects and what it produces |
| **Required Skills** | Skills the agent must load for this workflow |

## Key Guidelines

- Every prompt must specify an `agent` field routing to a `tsh-` prefixed agent name
- Every prompt must specify a `model` field (e.g., `GPT-5.4`)
- Prompt filenames follow `tsh-<action>/SKILL.md` convention
- Prompts should not redefine, override, or contradict the agent's identity

## Validation Checklist

- YAML frontmatter includes `agent`, `model`, `description`
- Agent reference uses `tsh-` prefix
- No personality or behavioral content (agent territory)
- No reusable workflow steps (skill territory)
- No coding standards (instructions territory)
