# Skills Overview

Cursor Collections includes **32 reusable workflow skills** — knowledge modules that provide specialized domain expertise, structured processes, and quality templates. They encode tested best practices for every phase of the product lifecycle. Skills are stored in `.cursor/skills/workflows/` and loaded automatically by agents when their domain applies to the current task.

## How Skills Work

Each skill folder contains a `SKILL.md` file with:

- **Domain-specific guidelines** — Best practices, checklists, and processes.
- **Templates** — Example output formats (e.g., `plan.example.md`, `research.example.md`).
- **Connected skills** — References to other skills that complement or support this one.

When an agent starts a task, it checks all available skills and decides which ones to load. Multiple skills can be combined for tasks spanning different domains.

Skills can also be referenced manually with `@tsh-skill-name` in chat.

## Loading Priority

Skills follow a strict priority hierarchy:

1. **Cursor rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files) — highest priority.
2. **Existing codebase patterns** — replicate established conventions.
3. **Skill guidelines** — domain best practices and templates.
4. **External documentation** — framework docs, OWASP, industry standards.

This ensures consistency: existing patterns are never overridden unless explicitly requested.
