| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Component Quality**   | Anti-patterns, composition issues, prop drilling, god components |
| **Hooks Correctness**   | Dependency arrays, cleanup, rules of hooks violations            |
| **Rendering**           | Unnecessary re-renders, unstable references, missing memoization |
| **Accessibility**       | Missing ARIA, keyboard traps, contrast violations                |
| **Performance**         | Bundle impact, large dependencies, unoptimized assets            |
