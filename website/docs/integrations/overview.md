# Integrations Overview

Cursor Collections integrates with **11 external services** via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. These integrations bring Jira, Figma, documentation, browser automation, structured reasoning, document reading, and cloud provider APIs directly into your Copilot sessions — enabling the end-to-end product engineering workflow.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol allows Cursor agents to call external tools as part of their workflow. Each MCP server exposes specific capabilities (search, navigate, execute) that agents can use to gather information or perform actions.

## Server Types

- **stdio** — Runs locally via `npx` or `uvx`. The MCP server starts as a child process.
- **HTTP** — Connects to a remote API endpoint. Requires authentication (handled by the service).
