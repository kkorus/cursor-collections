# Integrations Overview

Cursor Collections integrates with **11 external services** via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. These integrations bring Jira, Figma, documentation, browser automation, structured reasoning, document reading, and cloud provider APIs directly into your Cursor Agent sessions — enabling the end-to-end product engineering workflow.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol allows Cursor agents to call external tools as part of their workflow. Each MCP server exposes specific capabilities (search, navigate, execute) that agents can use to gather information or perform actions.

## Configuration

All servers are configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "figma": {
      "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    },
    "atlassian": {
      "url": "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp",

    },
    "awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server@latest"]
    },
    "awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION": "aws"
      }
    },
    "gcp-gcloud": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/gcloud-mcp"]
    },
    "gcp-observability": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/observability-mcp"]
    },
    "gcp-storage": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/storage-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Figma-backed UI verification, this MCP template is necessary but not sufficient on its own. EXPECTED comes from Figma MCP, while ACTUAL is collected by `tsh-ui-capture-worker` through Playwright CLI artifacts against a running app and an exact user-confirmed full dev server URL.

## Server Types

- **stdio** — Runs locally via `npx` or `uvx`. The MCP server starts as a child process.
- **HTTP** — Connects to a remote API endpoint. Requires authentication (handled by the service).
