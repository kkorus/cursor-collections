# Workflow Overview

Cursor Collections is an AI product engineering framework that covers the **full product lifecycle** through a structured workflow:

> **Ideate → Implement → Review**

The Implement phase internally handles research and planning automatically. Each phase is executed by a specialized agent and produces documented artifacts. This ensures consistent, high-quality outputs across teams — from workshop materials all the way to production-ready, reviewed code.

:::tip The Relay Race Metaphor
Think of this workflow as a **relay race**. Each phase produces a deliverable — the "baton" — that is reviewed by the human and then passed to the next phase. Workshop materials feed the backlog, the Engineering Manager orchestrates research, planning, and implementation as a single flow, and the implementation feeds the review. Nothing is lost between steps, and every handoff is a documented artifact.

## The Phases

### 1. Ideate

- **Agent:** Business Analyst
- **Commands:** `/tsh-explore-materials <workshop materials>` or `/tsh-analyze-materials <workshop materials>`
- Can start with exploration-only business/context synthesis before backlog extraction.
- Processes workshop materials through intent brief, extraction, quality review, Jira formatting, and verified Jira sync.
- Uses Gate 0, Gate 1, Gate 1.5, and Gate 2 as mandatory human review points.
- **Produces:** Exploration summaries, intent briefs, Jira-ready epics and stories, and refreshed backlog continuity artifacts.

### 2. Implement

- **Agent:** Engineering Manager (orchestrates specialized agents)
- **Command:** `/tsh-implement <JIRA_ID or description>`
- Automatically handles the full development cycle:
  1. **Research** — Delegates to Context Engineer to gather context from Jira, Figma, and codebase. Asks for user confirmation before proceeding.
  2. **Plan** — Delegates to Architect to create a structured implementation plan. Asks for user confirmation before proceeding.
  3. **Implement** — Delegates to Software Engineer, Prompt Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or E2E Engineer based on task type.
- Tracks progress, runs quality checks after each task, and auto-triggers code review.
- **Produces:** Research document, implementation plan, and concrete code modifications.

### 3. Review

- **Agent:** Code Reviewer
- **Command:** `/tsh-review <JIRA_ID or description>`
- Performs a structured code review against acceptance criteria, security, reliability, and maintainability.
- **Produces:** Structured review with clear pass/blockers/suggestions.

## Human Review at Every Step

:::warning Important
Each step requires your review and verification. Open the generated documents, go through them carefully, and iterate as many times as needed until the output looks correct. AI assistance does not replace human judgment — treat each output as a draft that needs your approval before proceeding.

## Workflow Variants

The full lifecycle has specialized variants for different task types:

- **[Workshop Analysis Flow](./workshop-flow)** — Explore workshop context with `/tsh-explore-materials` or convert materials into Jira-ready epics and stories with `/tsh-analyze-materials`.
- **[Standard Flow](./standard-flow)** — Backend/fullstack tasks using `/tsh-implement` → `/tsh-review` (research and planning happen internally).
- **[Frontend Flow](./frontend-flow)** — UI tasks with Figma verification using `/tsh-implement` (which internally uses `/tsh-implement-ui`) and `/tsh-review-ui`.
- **[E2E Testing Flow](./e2e-flow)** — End-to-end test creation delegated by the Engineering Manager to the E2E Engineer via `/tsh-implement`.
