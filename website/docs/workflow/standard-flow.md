# Standard Flow

The standard workflow is used for backend and fullstack tasks. The Engineering Manager orchestrates the full cycle: research → plan → plan validation → implement → review.

The flow accepts a task description, Jira ID, standalone `*.research.md`, or `*.plan.md`. A missing research or plan companion routes to preparation; it never authorizes implementation without a current actionable plan. Before the first file-changing delegation, the Engineering Manager must obtain Human approval of the exact current plan revision. An automated `tsh-plan-reviewer` `APPROVED` verdict is Reviewer approval only and is not permission to implement.

On every delegated or direct execution-owner entry path, the owner reads and validates the referenced plan from disk before changing files. If validation fails, it fails closed, names the exact failed field, condition, or file, and asks the user in chat which next step to take, spelling out the recovery choices: point to the correct plan path, obtain Human approval for an existing plan, start plan preparation, or, for a delegated subagent, hand back to `tsh-engineering-manager`. A response to that question is never Human approval, and implementation remains authorized only by Human Approval of the exact current plan revision.

## Step-by-Step Command Sequence

### 1. Implement

```text
/tsh-implement <JIRA_ID or task description>
```

The Engineering Manager automatically handles the full development cycle:

#### Research Phase (internal)

- **Delegated to:** Context Engineer
- **What it does:** Gathers all available information about the task from the codebase, Jira, Confluence, Figma, and other sources.
- **What it produces:** A `.research.md` file with task summary, assumptions, open questions, and suggested next steps.
- **Your action:** Review the generated research document for accuracy. This review is a quality checkpoint, not a separate authorization gate — the binding gate happens later, before implementation begins.

#### Planning Phase (internal)

- **Delegated to:** Architect
- **What it does:** Creates a multi-step implementation plan grouped into phases and tasks aligned with your repo structure.
- **What it produces:** A `.plan.md` file with checklist-style phases that can be executed by specialized agents.
- **Your action:** Wait for the plan validation phase to complete before reviewing.

#### Plan Validation Phase (internal)

- **Delegated to:** Plan Reviewer
- **What it does:** Runs a lightweight final reality check of the plan against the research file, codebase assumptions, feasibility, sequencing traps, and execution risks before implementation begins, in one invocation per plan lifecycle.
- **What it produces:** A `.plan-review.md` file alongside the plan with verdict (`APPROVED` or `REVISIONS NEEDED`) and structured findings.
- **Your action:** Review the implementation plan and review report together for scope, phases, and acceptance criteria. The manager then presents the exact current plan revision for Human approval before implementation begins.

#### Implementation Phase

- **Delegated to:** Plan Implementor (DEFAULT, for actionable low-risk plan seams), Software Engineer (EXCEPTION, for complex non-UI work), Prompt Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or E2E Engineer — routed by task type
- **What it does:** Executes the plan by delegating to specialized agents. Tracks progress and runs quality checks after each task.
- **What it produces:** Concrete code modifications applied by delegated agents.
- **Your action:** Review code changes after each phase. Test functionality. Verify against the plan.

:::tip
If a `.research.md` or `.plan.md` file already exists for the task, the Engineering Manager can reuse it after checking readiness. Reuse never skips the Human approval gate. A material revision after Human approval requires renewed Human approval before further file-changing work, and no Reviewer re-review is invoked automatically.

### 2. Review

```text
/tsh-review <JIRA_ID or task description>
```

- **Agent:** Code Reviewer
- **What it does:** Reviews the final implementation against the plan and requirements. Highlights security, reliability, performance, and maintainability concerns.
- **What it produces:** Structured review with clear pass/blockers/suggestions.
- **Your action:** Review findings and recommendations. Address all blockers before merging.

## Example End-to-End Usage

```text
1⃣️ /tsh-implement <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 🔍 Engineering Manager delegates to Context Engineer for research
   ↳ 📖 Review the generated research document (quality checkpoint, not an authorization gate)
   ↳ 🧱 Engineering Manager delegates to Architect for planning
   ↳ 🧪 Engineering Manager delegates to Plan Reviewer for plan validation
   ↳ 📖 Review the implementation plan and review summary
   ↳ ✅ Human approves the exact current plan revision — the only gate that authorizes implementation
   ↳ 💻 Engineering Manager delegates implementation to the owning specialist (Plan Implementor by default, Software Engineer for complex non-UI work, or the matching domain owner)
   ↳ 📖 Review code changes after each phase
   ↳ ✅ Test functionality, verify against plan

2⃣️ /tsh-review   <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review findings and recommendations
   ↳ ✅ Address blockers before merging
```

## Input Flexibility

You can run the same flow with any of the four primary inputs:

- A **Jira ticket ID** (e.g., `PROJ-123`) — the agent will pull context from Jira automatically via the Atlassian MCP.
- A **free-form task description** (e.g., `"Add pagination to the user list API"`) — the agent will work from the description and codebase analysis.
- A standalone **`*.research.md`** file — reused as the research artifact when it is already complete.
- A **`*.plan.md`** implementation plan — reused after a readiness check; a missing companion still routes to preparation rather than authorizing implementation without a current actionable plan.

## Task Labeling: CREATE / MODIFY / REUSE

Every task in an implementation plan is labeled with one of three action types. This helps developers understand the scope and impact of each task at a glance:

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **CREATE** | New code that doesn't exist yet | "Create a new `UserService` class" |
| **MODIFY** | Change existing code | "Update the `getUsers` endpoint to support pagination" |
| **REUSE** | Use existing code as-is, no changes needed | "Reuse the existing `AuthMiddleware` for the new route" |

These labels are assigned during the **Plan** phase by the Architect agent. During the **Implement** phase, the delegated implementer — Plan Implementor by default, Software Engineer for complex non-UI work, or the matching domain specialist — uses them to understand what needs to be built from scratch, what needs careful modification of existing logic, and what can be leveraged without changes.
