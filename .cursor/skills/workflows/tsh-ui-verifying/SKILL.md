# UI Verification

Verification process, criteria, and tolerances for comparing UI implementations against Figma designs.

## Verification Process

Use the checklist below and track your progress:

```
Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Validate inputs
- [ ] Step 2: Get EXPECTED from Figma
- [ ] Step 3: Get ACTUAL from implementation
- [ ] Step 4: Compare using verification categories
- [ ] Step 5: Generate report
```

**Step 1: Validate inputs**

Before starting verification, confirm:

- Figma URL is available for the component/section being verified
- Dev server URL is **confirmed by the user**:
  - Check the project configuration (`package.json` scripts, `.env`, `vite.config`, `next.config`, etc.) for the configured port
  - **MANDATORY**: On first verification in a session, ask the user to confirm the dev server URL (e.g., "I detected port 3001 from package.json — is the frontend app running at http://localhost:3001?"). **Do not guess** from running processes, `ps`, `netstat`, or `lsof` output — multiple services may run on different ports and you cannot reliably distinguish frontend from backend.
  - Use the **user-confirmed** URL for all subsequent verifications in the same session
- Dev server is running and the **target page** is accessible at that URL:
  - Navigate to the specific page URL using `playwright`
  - If the page **redirects to a login/authentication screen**: stop and ask the user — "The page redirected to [login URL]. How should I authenticate? Please provide credentials, a session token, or tell me how to bypass authentication for local development."
  - If the page shows **unexpected content** (error page, blank page, different route): stop and ask the user — "The page at [URL] shows [description]. Is this the correct URL for [component name]?"
  - **Do not proceed with verification if you cannot see the expected component.** Ask the user for help.
- If any input is missing or any blocker is encountered, **stop and ask the user** — do not proceed, do not fall back to code-level review, do not skip the verification step

**Step 2: Get EXPECTED from Figma**

Use `figma` to extract the design specifications:

- Layer hierarchy and component structure
- Layout direction, alignment, spacing
- Frame widths relative to page — these determine whether containers should be narrow/centered or full-width
- Typography, colors, radii, shadows
- Component variants and states

**Step 3: Get ACTUAL from implementation**

Use `playwright` to capture the running implementation. You MUST collect **all three** types of data — a verification that skips any type is incomplete:

1. **Structure & content** — element hierarchy, order, grouping (via accessibility snapshot)
2. **Actual rendered dimensions** — computed widths, heights, paddings, margins, gaps of every major container (via JavaScript evaluation of computed styles). This is the most commonly missed step — without it you cannot detect sizing/layout differences.
3. **Visual appearance** — full-page screenshot for side-by-side comparison with the design. Save screenshots to the task's specifications folder (e.g., `specifications/<task-id>/screenshots/`) with descriptive filenames including the component name and iteration number (e.g., `establishment-details-form-iteration-1.png`). This creates a visual audit trail for each verification cycle.

> **CRITICAL**: The accessibility tree does NOT contain CSS dimensions. A full-width container and a narrow centered container produce identical accessibility trees. If you only collected structure without measuring actual rendered dimensions, your verification is INVALID — mark confidence as LOW and report what's missing.

**Step 4: Compare using verification categories**

Compare EXPECTED (Figma) against ACTUAL (implementation) following the Verification Order and Categories below. The Figma design is the **source of truth** for every comparison. When in doubt, the design wins.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete ALL verification categories in a single pass. Do not stop after finding differences in one category — continue through every category and collect every difference. The report must contain ALL differences found across all categories so the engineer can fix them all at once, minimizing verification iterations.

**Step 5: Generate report**

Produce a structured report following the Report Format below. Include exact values from both Figma and implementation for every difference found.

## Verification Order

Always verify in this order — **complete ALL categories regardless of findings**. Do not stop after finding differences in one category. The goal is to catch every difference in a single pass so all fixes can be applied at once.

1. **Structure** (CRITICAL)
2. **Layout** (CRITICAL)
3. **Dimensions** (CRITICAL)
4. **Visual** (CRITICAL)
5. **Components**

## Verification Categories

### Structure (CRITICAL)

| Check                   | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Container hierarchy** | Does DOM structure match Figma's layer hierarchy?        |
| **Nesting depth**       | Are elements nested at the same level as in Figma?       |
| **Grouping**            | Are related elements grouped together as in design?      |
| **Element order**       | Is the visual order of elements the same?                |
| **Wrapper elements**    | Are there extra/missing wrapper divs that change layout? |
| **Sections present**    | Are ALL sections from Figma present in implementation?   |

### Layout (CRITICAL)

| Check                   | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flex/Grid direction** | row vs column, wrap behavior                       |
| **Alignment**           | justify-content, align-items values                |
| **Distribution**        | How space is distributed between elements          |
| **Positioning**         | relative, absolute, fixed - matches design intent? |
| **Centering**           | Is content centered as in design?                  |

### Dimensions (CRITICAL)

| Check                        | Description                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Container width**          | max-width, fixed width constraints           |
| **Card/panel boundaries**    | Does card have same width as in Figma?       |
| **Content area vs viewport** | Ratio of content width to available space    |
| **Width/Height**             | Fixed, percentage, auto, min/max constraints |
| **Spacing**                  | Padding, margin, gap between elements        |
| **Gaps**                     | Space between flex/grid children             |

> **WARNING**: Accessibility tree does NOT contain CSS dimensions. A full-width container and a narrow centered one look identical in it. You must measure actual computed styles to detect width/sizing differences.

### Visual

| Check           | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Typography**  | font-family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing |
| **Colors**      | Text, background, border colors                        |
| **Radii**       | border-radius values                                   |
| **Shadows**     | box-shadow, drop-shadow                                |
| **Backgrounds** | Solid, gradient, image                                 |

### Components

| Check                | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Correct variants** | Is the right variant of a component used?       |
| **Design tokens**    | Are correct tokens used (not hardcoded values)? |
| **States**           | hover, focus, active, disabled states           |

## Tolerances

| Category         | Tolerance       | Notes                                |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Structure        | **None**        | Any structural difference = FAIL     |
| Layout direction | **None**        | row vs column must match exactly     |
| Alignment        | **None**        | Centering, justify, align must match |
| Dimensions       | **1-2px**       | Only for browser rendering variance  |
| Colors           | **Exact match** | Must use correct design tokens       |
| Typography       | **Exact match** | Font properties must match           |
| Spacing          | **1-2px**       | Only for browser rendering variance  |

## Severity Definitions

| Severity     | Description                                        | Action                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Structure/layout differences, wrong component used | Must fix immediately              |
| **Major**    | Dimensions off by >2px, wrong colors/typography    | Must fix before merge             |
| **Minor**    | 1-2px browser rendering variance                   | Acceptable, document if recurring |
