## Wildly Important Goal

**Goal**: <one-sentence-statement-of-the-single-most-important-outcome-this-plan-must-achieve>

**Success Measure**: <one-sentence-stating-the-condition-that-proves-the-goal-is-achieved>

**Do NOT touch / do NOT add**: <compact-clause-list-or-short-bullet-list-of-out-of-scope-items>

## Proposed Solution

<description-of-proposed-solution-explaining-the-approach-and-the-why-for-reviewers-and-implementors>

<necessary-diagrams>

<!-- Note: The plan must not contain real implementation code or full implementation bodies/function logic. Pseudo-code is allowed only to explain genuinely complicated algorithms or ideas, and task-boundary seam artifacts such as type definitions, function signatures, DTOs, interfaces, and API shapes are allowed when they clarify the contract without supplying implementation bodies. Diagrams, explanations, and the Technical Context chapter content are allowed and encouraged. -->

## Human Approval

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Plan Revision | 1 |
| Human Decision | PENDING |
| Approved Revision | — |
| Decision Timestamp | — |
| Note | <optional concise note> |

<human-approval-protocol>
The Architect owns material plan revision changes and records only literal explicit human responses. `Human Decision` must be exactly one of `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, or `STOPPED`. `Decision Timestamp` is ISO 8601 UTC ending in `Z`. Human approval is not stored in `.plan-review.md`. Persisted approval is valid if and only if `Human Decision=APPROVED`, `Approved Revision=current Plan Revision`, and `Decision Timestamp` is valid ISO 8601 UTC ending in `Z`; a fresh session requires that exact predicate.

Material changes before implementation completion increment `Plan Revision`, set `Human Decision=PENDING`, clear `Approved Revision`, and explain the change in Changelog. A material change after an earlier Human approval immediately halts further file-changing delegation and mandates automated re-review with no low-risk exemption before renewed Human approval. The low-risk exemption applies only to initial preparation before any Human approval. Routine task checkbox/progress/status updates and execution/review recording do not invalidate approval. This mechanism is instruction-level and auditable, neither cryptographic nor platform enforcement.

## Technical Context

Project conventions, coding standards, and patterns discovered during planning. Downstream agents MUST read this section instead of re-discovering the same context.

### Project Instructions

- <summary of relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rules — file path + key rules>

### Architecture & Patterns

- <framework, layering, module organization, folder structure conventions>
- <naming conventions, file naming patterns>

### Tech Stack

- <language, framework, key libraries with versions>
- <package manager, build tool, test runner>

### Code Style & Standards

- <formatting, linting rules, import conventions>
- <error handling patterns, validation approach>

### Testing Patterns

- <test framework, test file naming, mocking strategy>
- <test commands: unit, integration, e2e, lint, build>

### Database Patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: <phase-name>

**Goal**: <how-this-phase-advances-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: <broader-explanation-of-what-should-be-done-and-why>

**Verification:** <fast checks from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns; never assumed from Node/npm>

<!-- Source every Verification and DoD command from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns. Examples by stack:
	Node:   pnpm test:unit -- <spec>; tsc --noEmit
	Python: uv run pytest <path>; uv run ruff check
-->

<!-- Phase Description states the broader why for reviewers and implementors. Task Description uses a near-imperative form that names the files and the behavior. -->

**Files:** `src/<feature>.ts` (create), `src/<feature>.types.ts` (reuse)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

#### Task 1.2 - [CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE] <task-name>

**Description**: <brief description>

**Files:** `src/<feature>.ts` (modify — created in Task 1.1), `src/<feature>.test.ts` (reuse)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

#### Task 1.3 - [CREATE/MODIFY] <docs-or-config-task-name>

**Description**: <brief description of a docs, config, content, or asset change that has no runnable command>

**Files:** `docs/<file>.md` (modify)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] `docs/<file>.md contains an "## Usage" section` _(deterministic reviewer check — a docs-only task has no runnable command)_

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

Pass the Figma URL and dev server URL. If verification fails, delegate fix to `tsh-ui-engineer` and re-verify (max 5 iterations per component).

**Files:** `src/components/<ui-component-name>.tsx` (reuse), `src/components/<ui-component-name>.test.tsx` (reuse)

**Figma URL**: <figma-url-for-this-component>

**UI Verification Status**: For Figma-based UI features only. Track this separately from code review.

**Verification:** <fast checks from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns; never assumed from Node/npm>

#### Task 4.1 - [REUSE] Code review by `tsh-code-reviewer` agent

**Description**: Run `tsh-code-reviewer` agent following the `tsh-review` command skill, resolved per `tsh-resolving-skill-references`, to review the complete implementation. Pass e2e test execution to that agent as part of the delegation — do not run e2e tests outside this review.
