## Current Implementation Analysis

### Already Implemented

List of existing components, functions, utilities that will be reused (with file paths):

- <component/function> - `<file-path>` - <brief description>

### To Be Modified

List of existing code that needs changes or extensions (with file paths and description of changes):

- <component/function> - `<file-path>` - <what needs to change>

### To Be Created

List of new components, functions, utilities that need to be built from scratch:

- <component/function> - <brief description of what it does>

## Technical Context

Project conventions, coding standards, and patterns discovered during planning. Downstream agents MUST read this section instead of re-discovering the same context.

### Project Instructions

- <summary of relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rules — file path + key rules>

### Architecture & Patterns

- <framework, layering, module organization, folder structure conventions>
- <naming conventions, file naming patterns>

### Tech Stack

- <language, framework, key libraries with versions>
- <package manager, build tool, test runner>

### Code Style & Standards

- <formatting, linting rules, import conventions>
- <error handling patterns, validation approach>

### Testing Patterns

- <test framework, test file naming, mocking strategy>
- <test commands: unit, integration, e2e, lint, build>

### Database Patterns

- <ORM, migration tool, entity conventions (if applicable)>

### Additional Context

- <any other project-specific conventions relevant to implementation>

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: <phase-name>

**Goal**: <how-this-phase-advances-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: <broader-explanation-of-what-should-be-done-and-why>

#### Task 1.1 - [CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE] <task-name>

**Description**: <brief description of what the task entails>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion>
- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

#### Task 1.2 - [CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE] <task-name>

**Description**: <brief description>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

### Phase 2: <ui-phase-name>

**Goal**: <how-this-phase-advances-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: <broader-explanation-of-what-should-be-done-and-why>

#### Task 2.1 - [CREATE/MODIFY] <ui-component-name>

**Description**: <implementation of the UI component based on Figma design>

**Figma URL**: <figma-url-for-this-component>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion>
- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

#### Task 2.2 - [REUSE] UI Verification of <ui-component-name> by `tsh-ui-reviewer` agent

**Description**: Run `tsh-ui-reviewer` agent via `.cursor/skills/commands/tsh-review-ui/SKILL.md` to verify <ui-component-name> against Figma design. Pass the Figma URL and dev server URL. If verification fails, delegate fix to `tsh-software-engineer` and re-verify (max 5 iterations per component).

**Figma URL**: <figma-url-for-this-component>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] UI verification passes or escalated to user after 5 iterations
- [ ] Verification report documented in Changelog

### Phase 3: <phase-name>

**Goal**: <how-this-phase-advances-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: <broader-explanation-of-what-should-be-done-and-why>

#### Task 3.1 - [CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE] <task-name>

**Description**: <brief description>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

### Phase 4: Code Review

**Goal**: <how-verified-quality-of-the-delivered-changes-secures-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: Final verification of the full implementation. This phase is mandatory and always comes last.

#### Task 4.1 - [REUSE] Code review by `tsh-code-reviewer` agent

**Description**: Run `tsh-code-reviewer` agent via `.cursor/skills/commands/tsh-review/SKILL.md` to review the complete implementation. Pass e2e test execution to that agent as part of the delegation — do not run e2e tests outside this review.

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] Code review passes with no blocking findings
- [ ] E2e tests executed by the reviewer pass
- [ ] Review outcome documented in Changelog

**Clues**: <optional-pointers-to-review-scope-or-risk-areas>
