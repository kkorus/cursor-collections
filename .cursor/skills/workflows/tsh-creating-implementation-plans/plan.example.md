## Wildly Important Goal

**Goal**: <one-sentence-statement-of-the-single-most-important-outcome-this-plan-must-achieve>

**Success Measure**: <one-sentence-stating-the-condition-that-proves-the-goal-is-achieved>

**Do NOT touch / do NOT add**: <compact-clause-list-or-short-bullet-list-of-out-of-scope-items>

## Proposed Solution

<description-of-proposed-solution-explaining-the-approach-and-the-why-for-reviewers-and-implementors>

<necessary-diagrams>

<!-- Note: The plan must not contain real implementation code or full implementation bodies/function logic. Pseudo-code is allowed only to explain genuinely complicated algorithms or ideas, and task-boundary seam artifacts such as type definitions, function signatures, DTOs, interfaces, and API shapes are allowed when they clarify the contract without supplying implementation bodies. Diagrams, explanations, and the Technical Context chapter content are allowed and encouraged. -->

## Technical Context

Project conventions, coding standards, and patterns discovered during planning. Downstream agents MUST read this section instead of re-discovering the same context.

### Project Instructions

- <summary of relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rules — file path + key rules>

### Architecture & Patterns

- <framework, layering, module organization, folder structure conventions>
- <naming conventions, file naming patterns>

### Tech Stack

- <language, framework, key libraries with versions>
- <package manager, build tool, test runner>

### Code Style & Standards

- <formatting, linting rules, import conventions>
- <error handling patterns, validation approach>

### Testing Patterns

- <test framework, test file naming, mocking strategy>
- <test commands: unit, integration, e2e, lint, build>

### Database Patterns

- <ORM, migration tool, entity conventions (if applicable)>

### Additional Context

- <any other project-specific conventions relevant to implementation>

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: <phase-name>

**Goal**: <how-this-phase-advances-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: <broader-explanation-of-what-should-be-done-and-why>

**Verification:** <fast checks from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns; never assumed from Node/npm>

<!-- Source every Verification and DoD command from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns. Examples by stack:
	Node:   pnpm test:unit -- <spec>; tsc --noEmit
	Python: uv run pytest <path>; uv run ruff check
-->

<!-- Phase Description states the broader why for reviewers and implementors. Task Description uses a near-imperative form that names the files and the behavior. -->

#### Task 1.1 - [CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE] <task-name>

**Description**: <brief description of what the task entails>

**Files:** `src/<feature>.ts` (create), `src/<feature>.types.ts` (reuse)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

#### Task 1.2 - [CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE] <task-name>

**Description**: <brief description>

**Files:** `src/<feature>.ts` (modify — created in Task 1.1), `src/<feature>.test.ts` (reuse)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

#### Task 1.3 - [CREATE/MODIFY] <docs-or-config-task-name>

**Description**: <brief description of a docs, config, content, or asset change that has no runnable command>

**Files:** `docs/<file>.md` (modify)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] `docs/<file>.md contains an "## Usage" section` _(deterministic reviewer check — a docs-only task has no runnable command)_

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

### Phase 2: <ui-phase-name>

**Goal**: <how-this-phase-advances-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: <broader-explanation-of-what-should-be-done-and-why>

**Verification:** <fast checks from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns; never assumed from Node/npm>

#### Task 2.1 - [CREATE/MODIFY] <ui-component-name>

**Description**: <implementation of the UI component based on Figma design>

**Files:** `src/components/<ui-component-name>.tsx` (modify), `src/components/<ui-component-name>.types.ts` (reuse)

**Figma URL**: <figma-url-for-this-component>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] <specific verifiable criterion in the listed files>
- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

**Clues**: <optional-hints-for-the-implementor-file-paths-reference-patterns-gotchas>

#### Task 2.2 - [REUSE] UI Verification of <ui-component-name> by `tsh-ui-reviewer` agent

**Description**: Run `tsh-ui-reviewer` agent via `.cursor/skills/commands/tsh-review-ui/SKILL.md` to verify <ui-component-name> against Figma design. Pass the Figma URL and dev server URL. If verification fails, delegate fix to `tsh-software-engineer` and re-verify (max 5 iterations per component).

**Files:** `src/components/<ui-component-name>.tsx` (reuse), `src/components/<ui-component-name>.test.tsx` (reuse)

**Figma URL**: <figma-url-for-this-component>

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`
- [ ] UI verification passes via `tsh-ui-reviewer` or escalated to user after 5 iterations
- [ ] Verification report documented in Changelog

**Stop Rule:** <stop condition, or omit>

### Phase 4: Code Review

**Goal**: <how-verified-quality-of-the-delivered-changes-secures-the-wildly-important-goal>

**Description**: Final verification of the full implementation. This phase is mandatory and always comes last.

**Verification:** <fast checks from Technical Context → Tech Stack / Testing Patterns; never assumed from Node/npm>

#### Task 4.1 - [REUSE] Code review by `tsh-code-reviewer` agent

**Description**: Run `tsh-code-reviewer` agent via `.cursor/skills/commands/tsh-review/SKILL.md` to review the complete implementation. Pass e2e test execution to that agent as part of the delegation — do not run e2e tests outside this review.

**Files:** `src/<feature>.ts` (reuse), `src/<feature>.spec.ts` (reuse)

**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] Run `<verification command from Technical Context → Testing Patterns>`
- [ ] Code review passes with no blocking findings
