# Ensuring Accessibility

Provides WCAG 2.1 AA compliance patterns for building inclusive frontend interfaces with proper semantic markup, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.

<principles>

<semantic-html-first>
Start with the correct HTML element. `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation, `<nav>` for navigation regions, `<main>` for primary content. Native semantics are free, reliable, and require zero ARIA. Only reach for ARIA when HTML alone cannot convey the meaning.
</semantic-html-first>

<keyboard-is-mandatory>
Every interaction available to a mouse user must be available to a keyboard user. Tab, Escape, Enter, Space, Arrow keys — these are the vocabulary of keyboard interaction. Missing keyboard support is not a minor issue — it is a blocker for many users.
</keyboard-is-mandatory>

<never-color-alone>
Color must never be the sole means of conveying information. Error states need icons + text, not just red borders. Status indicators need labels, not just colored dots. Always pair visual indicators with non-visual alternatives.
</never-color-alone>

</principles>

## Accessibility Implementation Process

Use the checklist below and track your progress:

```
Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Choose semantic elements
- [ ] Step 2: Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Step 3: Add ARIA where HTML falls short
- [ ] Step 4: Verify color and contrast
- [ ] Step 5: Test with assistive technology
```

**Step 1: Choose semantic elements**

Select the correct HTML element for each piece of UI:

- **Interactive elements**:
  - `<button>` — actions (submit, toggle, open menu)
  - `<a href>` — navigation to another page or location
  - `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` — form data entry
- **Landmarks**:
  - `<header>` — page or section header
  - `<nav>` — navigation region
  - `<main>` — primary content (one per page)
  - `<aside>` — tangentially related content
  - `<footer>` — page or section footer
- **Structure**:
  - `<article>` — self-contained composition
  - `<section>` — thematic grouping (must have a heading)
  - `<details>` / `<summary>` — native expand/collapse
- **Heading hierarchy**:
  - One `<h1>` per page
  - Logical nesting: `h2` → `h3` → `h4`
  - Never skip levels (e.g., `h2` → `h4`)
- **Lists**:
  - `<ul>` / `<ol>` for collections of items
  - `<dl>` for key-value pairs (definition lists)

If the component library wraps these elements, verify the rendered HTML output matches expectations using browser devtools.

**Step 2: Implement keyboard navigation**

All interactive elements must be focusable. Native interactive elements (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`) are focusable by default. Custom interactive elements need `tabindex="0"`.

- **Tab order** must follow visual and logical reading order. Avoid `tabindex` values greater than 0 — they create unpredictable focus sequences.
- **Custom interactive components** need explicit keyboard handlers:

  | Component      | Keyboard behavior                                                |
  | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Button         | Enter + Space to activate                                        |
  | Menu           | Arrow keys to navigate items, Escape to close, Enter to select   |
  | Tabs           | Left/Right arrows to switch tabs, Tab to leave the tab group     |
  | Dialog / Modal | Tab trapped inside, Escape to close                              |
  | Accordion      | Enter/Space to expand/collapse, Arrow keys between headers       |
  | Combobox       | Arrow keys to navigate options, Enter to select, Escape to close |

- **Focus visibility** — never remove the focus outline (`outline: none`) without providing a visible replacement. Custom focus styles must have at least 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors.
- **Programmatic focus management** — move focus when context changes:
  - Modal opens → focus the first focusable element inside
  - Modal closes → return focus to the element that triggered it
  - Route change → focus the new page heading or main content
  - Dynamic content added → focus the new content or announce it via `aria-live`

**Step 3: Add ARIA where HTML falls short**

Rule: prefer native HTML semantics. Only add ARIA when HTML cannot express the pattern.

Common patterns requiring ARIA:

- **Icon-only buttons**: Add `aria-label="Close"` (or the appropriate action description).
- **Expandable sections**: `aria-expanded="true"` or `aria-expanded="false"` on the trigger element.
- **Live updates**: `aria-live="polite"` for non-urgent updates (data refreshed, filter applied). `aria-live="assertive"` for urgent updates (session expiring, critical error).
- **Dialogs**: `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` pointing to the dialog title, `aria-describedby` pointing to the dialog description.
- **Form errors**:
  - `aria-invalid="true"` on the invalid field
  - `aria-describedby` pointing to the error message element
  - Error container with `role="alert"` or `aria-live="assertive"` for immediate announcement
- **Loading states**: Container with `role="status"` for the loading message (e.g., "Loading results..."). Note: `role="status"` implicitly sets `aria-live="polite"` — no need to add both.
- **Current page in navigation**: `aria-current="page"` on the active nav link.
- **Progress indicators**: `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`.

Never do:

- `role="button"` on a `<div>` — use `<button>` instead
- ARIA that duplicates native semantics (e.g., `role="heading"` on an `<h2>`)
- `aria-label` on non-interactive, non-landmark elements (screen readers may ignore it)

**Step 4: Verify color and contrast**

| Element                                           | Minimum contrast ratio | Examples                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Normal text (< 24px)                              | 4.5:1                  | Body text, labels, captions, small links      |
| Large text (≥ 24px / 18pt, or ≥ 19px / 14pt bold) | 3:1                    | Headings, large labels, prominent links       |
| Interactive component boundaries                  | 3:1                    | Button borders, input outlines, toggle tracks |
| Non-text content conveying information            | 3:1                    | Status icons, chart segments, badges          |

Additional rules:

- Never convey information through color alone. Error states need an icon or text label in addition to color. Status indicators need a text label, not just a colored dot.
- Ensure focus indicators meet 3:1 contrast against the background.
- Test both light and dark themes if the application supports them.
- Verify disabled states are visually distinguishable but don't need to meet contrast minimums (WCAG exempts disabled controls).

**Step 5: Test with assistive technology**

Run through these verification steps:

1. **Keyboard walkthrough**:
   - Tab through the entire page. Is every interactive element reachable?
   - Is the focus order logical (matches visual layout)?
   - Is focus always visible?
   - Can you dismiss overlays with Escape? Navigate menus with arrows?

2. **Screen reader verification**:
   - Do headings, landmarks, buttons, links, and form fields announce correctly?
   - Are images described (alt text) or hidden (`alt=""` for decorative)?
   - Do dynamic changes announce via live regions?
   - Do form errors announce when they appear?

3. **Zoom and reflow**:
   - At 200% zoom, is text resizable without loss of content or functionality? (SC 1.4.4)
   - At 400% zoom (320px viewport width), does content reflow without horizontal scrolling? (SC 1.4.10)
   - Are touch targets generously sized? (44×44 CSS pixels recommended as best practice — not a WCAG 2.1 AA requirement)

4. **Accessibility tree inspection**:
   - Open browser devtools → Accessibility tab.
   - Verify the semantic structure matches the intended component roles.
   - Check that ARIA attributes are correctly applied and not conflicting.

5. **Automated accessibility testing** (agent-actionable):
   - Run axe-core CLI against the page: `npx @axe-core/cli <URL>`.
   - If the URL is not known, ask the user for the URL before running.
   - Parse the output and group violations by impact level (critical, serious, moderate, minor).
   - For each violation, report: rule ID, impact, affected elements, and recommended fix.
   - Re-run after fixes to confirm violations are resolved.

| Need              | HTML Solution             | ARIA Fallback (only if HTML insufficient)       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Button            | `<button>`                | `role="button"` + `tabindex="0"` + key handlers |
| Link              | `<a href>`                | `role="link"` (rare)                            |

| Progress          | `<progress>`              | `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow`          |

## Contrast Requirements

| Element                                           | Minimum ratio | Example                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Normal text (< 24px)                              | 4.5:1         | Body text, labels, captions    |
| Large text (≥ 24px / 18pt, or ≥ 19px / 14pt bold) | 3:1           | Headings, large labels         |
| Interactive component boundaries                  | 3:1           | Button borders, input outlines |
| Non-text (icons conveying info)                   | 3:1           | Status icons, chart segments   |

```

## RTL / Bidirectional Text Support

| Rule                               | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use logical CSS properties         | `margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left`; `padding-inline-end` instead of `padding-right` |
| Let layout engine handle direction | Set `dir="rtl"` on root; avoid manual transforms for standard layout                            |
| Icons may need flipping            | Directional icons (arrows, progress bars) may need `transform: scaleX(-1)` in RTL               |
| Test both directions               | Verify layout, alignment, and text truncation in both LTR and RTL                               |
