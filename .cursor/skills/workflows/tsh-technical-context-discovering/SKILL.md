Use for any task requiring understanding of project conventions, coding standards, architecture patterns, and established practices before writing code.

# Technical Context Discovery

This skill provides a systematic approach for understanding a project's technical context before making any code changes. It ensures consistency with existing patterns and prevents introducing conflicting conventions.

## When to Use

- Before implementing any feature or fix
- Before writing tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Before making architectural decisions that affect existing code
- When onboarding to a new area of the codebase

## Technical Context Discovery Process

Use the checklist below and track your progress:

```
Discovery progress:
- [ ] Step 0: Check plan file for persisted context
- [ ] Step 1: Check Copilot instruction files
- [ ] Step 2: Analyze existing codebase patterns
- [ ] Step 3: Consult external documentation (if needed)
- [ ] Step 4: Apply the implementation rule
```

**Step 0: Check Plan File for Persisted Context**

**ALWAYS check first** whether a plan file (`*.plan.md`) exists for the current task and contains a **"Technical Context"** section.

If a "Technical Context" section exists and is populated:
- **Use it as-is** — do not re-discover conventions, patterns, or standards that are already documented there.
- Skip Steps 1-2 entirely. Proceed directly to Step 4 (Apply the implementation rule) using the persisted context.
- Only perform targeted discovery (Steps 1-2) for aspects **not covered** by the persisted context.

If no plan file exists, or the "Technical Context" section is missing/empty:
- Proceed with Steps 1-4 as normal.

**Step 1: Check Cursor Rule Files**

**ALWAYS check first** for existing Cursor rules in the project:

- Search for `.cursor/rules/cursor-instructions.md` at the repository root.
- Search for `*.mdc` rule files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
- Search for `.cursor/` directory with configuration files.

If rule files exist, they are the **primary source of truth** for:

- Coding standards and conventions
- Architecture patterns and project structure
- Technology stack specifics and version requirements
- Testing strategies and patterns
- Naming conventions and file organization
- Locator strategies (for E2E tests)
- Test data management approaches
- Environment configuration

**Step 2: Analyze Existing Codebase Patterns**

If no Cursor rules are found, or if they don't cover specific aspects, **analyze the existing codebase** to understand and replicate established patterns:

- **Architecture patterns**: Examine folder structure, layering (controllers, services, repositories), and module organization.
- **Code style**: Analyze existing files for naming conventions, formatting, and idioms used.
- **Error handling**: Look at how exceptions are caught, logged, and returned to clients.
- **Validation patterns**: Check how input validation is implemented (decorators, middleware, manual checks).
- **Testing patterns**: Review existing tests to understand structure, mocking strategies, assertion styles, fixtures, and test data management.
- **Database patterns**: Examine existing migrations, entities/models, and query patterns.
- **API patterns**: Analyze existing endpoints for response formats, status codes, and documentation style.
- **Configuration**: Check how environment variables, feature flags, and configuration are managed.

**Use `search` and `usages` tools** to find similar implementations in the codebase and follow the same approach.

**Step 3: Consult External Documentation**

If neither Copilot instructions nor sufficient existing codebase patterns are available (e.g., new project, greenfield feature, or first implementation of a specific pattern), **use external documentation and industry best practices**:

- **Use `context7` tool** to search for official documentation of the framework/library being used (check project config for exact versions first).
- Apply **industry-standard best practices** for the technology stack.
- Follow **OWASP security guidelines** for secure coding practices.
- Apply **SOLID principles** and clean architecture patterns.
- Use **well-established design patterns** appropriate for the use case.

**IMPORTANT**: When using best practices in a greenfield scenario, document your decisions in code comments or README to establish patterns for future development.

**Step 4: Apply the Implementation Rule**

Based on what you discovered, apply this decision hierarchy:

| Context Available | Action |
|---|---|
| Rule files exist | Follow them strictly. Rules take precedence over general best practices. |
| No rules, but codebase has patterns | Mirror existing patterns exactly. Consistency with existing code > theoretical best practices. |
| No rules, no existing patterns | Apply documentation-based best practices and industry standards. Document decisions for future reference. |

**Critical rule**: Never introduce new patterns unless explicitly requested by the user or specified in the implementation plan.
