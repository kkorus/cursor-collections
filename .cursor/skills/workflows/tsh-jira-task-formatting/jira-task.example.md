## Formatting Guidelines

### General Rules

- **Business language only**: Descriptions should be understandable by any stakeholder without technical knowledge
- **No implementation details**: Do not specify technologies, frameworks, or code patterns in stories — that is the architect's responsibility
- **Consistent tone**: Use active voice and present tense ("User can create…" not "User should be able to create…")
- **Verifiable acceptance criteria**: Every criterion must be testable with a clear pass/fail condition

### Priority Mapping

| Workshop Priority | Jira Priority | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Highest | Blocks all other work; must be done first |
| High | High | Core functionality; needed for MVP |
| Medium | Medium | Important but not blocking; can follow MVP |
| Low | Low | Nice-to-have; can be deferred |

### Labels

Labels are project-specific. Suggest labels based on the epic's domain area, but do not hardcode values. Common patterns:
- Feature area: `auth`, `payments`, `dashboard`, `reporting`
- Type: `infrastructure`, `integration`, `ui`, `backend`
- Source: `workshop-<date>` to track which workshop produced the task

### Handling Optional Fields

- If a field cannot be filled from the available materials, mark it as `TBD - to be discussed during refinement`
- Do not invent information to fill optional fields
- Flag all `TBD` fields for user review

### Jira Key Field

The `Jira Key` field is empty (`—`) when the task has not yet been pushed to Jira. It is populated automatically after issue creation or when importing existing Jira issues. When a Jira key is present, the push flow will **update** the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

- Do not manually fill this field — it is managed by the agent
- After a successful push, the agent writes the Jira key back into `jira-tasks.md`
- After a successful import, the agent populates the Jira key from the fetched issues

### Status Field

The `Status` field reflects the current Jira workflow status of the task (e.g., `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`, `Cancelled`, `PO APPROVE`). It is empty (`—`) for tasks that have not been pushed to or imported from Jira.

- Do not manually fill this field — it is managed by the agent
- After a successful import, the agent populates the Status from the fetched Jira issue
- After a successful push (create or update), the agent records the current status returned by Jira
- Tasks whose status is **Done**, **Cancelled**, or **PO APPROVE** are considered **protected** and are treated as read-only. The agent will not modify their content locally or push updates to Jira for them. See the Protected Status Policy in the agent file for full details.

## Example: Fully Populated Epic with Stories

### Epic: User Authentication: Secure Login and Account Access

**Jira Key**: —
**Status**: —
**Priority**: Highest

**Description**:
```
h2. Overview

Enable users to securely log in, manage their accounts, and recover access if credentials are lost. This is the foundational epic that gates access to all application features.

h2. Business Value

Without authentication, the application cannot distinguish between users, enforce permissions, or protect user data. This epic enables personalised experiences and regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOC2).

h2. Success Metrics

* Users can register, log in, and access their personalised dashboard
* Password recovery flow resolves 95% of access issues without support intervention
* All authentication flows complete in under 3 seconds
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
(/) Users can create an account with email and password
(/) Users can log in with valid credentials
(/) Users receive an error message for invalid credentials
(/) Users can reset their password via email

```

**Labels**: `auth`, `workshop-2026-02-19`
