# tsh-implement-terraform

This skill creates or modifies Terraform modules and provisions cloud infrastructure following established IaC patterns and safety guardrails. It ensures consistent resource configuration with proper naming, tagging, state management, and cost estimation before any infrastructure changes are applied.

The workflow respects existing project conventions, validates all changes through `terraform plan`, and automatically escalates architectural decisions (VPC design, service selection, multi-region) to the architect agent. Every implementation includes cost impact analysis and step-by-step apply instructions.

## Required Skills
Before starting, load and follow these skills:
- `tsh-implementing-terraform-modules` - for module patterns, state management, and safe infrastructure changes
- `tsh-technical-context-discovering` - to establish project conventions and existing Terraform patterns

---

## 1. Context

Follow the `tsh-technical-context-discovering` skill to identify existing Terraform setup.

Additionally, always:
- **Read the "Technical Context" section from the plan file** (`*.plan.md`) if it exists — it contains project conventions and patterns already discovered during planning. Use it as your primary source and skip re-discovery for aspects already covered.
- Check `*.mdc rules` only for aspects **not covered** by the plan's Technical Context
- Analyze existing Terraform modules and state configuration
- Discover environment organization (workspaces, Terragrunt)

---

## 2. Implementation

Follow the `tsh-implementing-terraform-modules` skill for:
- Module structure and interfaces
- Resource configurations with proper naming and tagging
- Variable definitions with validation
- State backend configuration

**Guardrails:**
- Always run `terraform plan` before any apply
- Never suggest `terraform apply -auto-approve` for production
- Ensure remote state is configured before applying
- Flag resources with significant cost impact (>10% increase)

---

## 3. Architect Consultation

Spawn `tsh-architect` sub-agent when:
- Designing new VPC/network topology
- Selecting between competing cloud services (ECS vs EKS, RDS vs Aurora)
- Implementing multi-region or disaster recovery architecture
- Making decisions with significant cost impact (>10% increase)

Skip for: adding resources to existing modules, updating versions, fixing bugs, adding tags.

## 4. Summary (required output)

```markdown
## Terraform Implementation Summary

### Current State
- [existing IaC configuration]

### Proposed Configuration
- Provider: [AWS / Azure / GCP]
- Resources: [list of resources to create/modify]

### Variables
| Variable | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|

### State Backend
- [remote state configuration]

### Cost Estimate
- [approximate monthly cost for new resources]

### Apply Instructions
1. `terraform init`
2. `terraform plan -out=tfplan`
3. Review plan output
4. `terraform apply tfplan`

### Files
- NEW/MODIFIED: [list of files created or modified]
```

## Scope

**Does NOT handle** (redirect to):
- CI/CD pipelines for Terraform → `tsh-implement-pipeline` skill
- Kubernetes workload configuration → `tsh-deploy-kubernetes` skill
- Monitoring infrastructure → `tsh-implement-observability` skill

Each redirect above names a skill reference, not a location — resolve it with the `tsh-resolving-skill-references` resolution order: the project skill collection, then the installed skills root (flat, no layer segment), then a search by name; internal skills are **read**, not invoked, and a skill that cannot be located is a **stop and ask the user**, never a redirect you drop.
