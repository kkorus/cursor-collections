# tsh-implement-observability

This skill implements comprehensive observability solutions covering metrics, logs, traces, and alerting. It establishes monitoring infrastructure that enables teams to understand system behavior, detect issues proactively, and maintain service level objectives through well-designed dashboards and alert rules.

The workflow follows RED/USE methodology for metrics collection, configures appropriate SLOs/SLIs with error budgets, and creates actionable alerts linked to runbooks. Decisions about new observability stacks, cross-service tracing architecture, or compliance-sensitive logging are escalated to the architect agent.

## Required Skills
Before starting, load and follow these skills:
- `tsh-implementing-observability` - for metrics, logs, traces, alerting patterns, SLO definitions, and dashboard design
- `tsh-technical-context-discovering` - to establish project conventions and existing monitoring patterns

---

## 1. Context

Follow the `tsh-technical-context-discovering` skill to identify existing observability setup.

Additionally, always:
- **Read the "Technical Context" section from the plan file** (`*.plan.md`) if it exists — it contains project conventions and patterns already discovered during planning. Use it as your primary source and skip re-discovery for aspects already covered.
- Check `*.mdc rules` only for aspects **not covered** by the plan's Technical Context
- Analyze existing monitoring configurations (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Discover existing alerting rules and dashboards

---

## 2. Implementation

Follow the `tsh-implementing-observability` skill for:
- Metrics collection configuration
- Log aggregation setup
- Distributed tracing instrumentation
- SLO/SLI definitions with error budgets
- Alert rules with runbooks
- Dashboard design

---

## 3. Architect Consultation

Spawn `tsh-architect` sub-agent when:
- Selecting observability stack for greenfield projects
- Designing cross-service tracing architecture
- Implementing centralized logging with compliance requirements

Skip for: adding alerts, creating dashboards, configuring log retention, adding metrics to existing stack.
