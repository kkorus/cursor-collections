# tsh-write-documentation

Your goal is to author or update repository documentation according to the delegated documentation task and the technical context provided in the handoff. Repository documentation spans README, CHANGELOG, in-repo `/docs`, and the published documentation site; the delegated task names the specific target.

Thoroughly review the delegated task slice, the relevant technical context, and the summary of any prior worker output before starting. Confirm the work is documentation-only and stays within the repository's documentation. If the task cannot be completed without changing product code, stop and report the dependency instead of editing code.

Stay strictly within the documentation files named in the delegated task. Do not expand scope, redesign unrelated pages, or change product code, tests, or infrastructure.

If you need to deviate from the delegated task, stop and report the deviation to the delegating orchestrator with the exact reason instead of proceeding on your own; record the change in the plan file's Changelog section only once the orchestrator confirms it, when a plan is in play.

## Required Skills

Before starting, load and follow these skills:

- `tsh-writing-documentation` - to follow documentation structure conventions, documentation-site build expectations, and the write-vs-review boundary.
- `tsh-technical-context-discovering` - to confirm project conventions and existing documentation patterns before writing.

## Execution Contract

This skill defines the handoff, not the documentation-writing procedure. Run the detailed step-by-step authoring and validation workflow from the `tsh-writing-documentation` skill, which is the single source of truth for how repository documentation is produced.

- **Inputs**: the delegated documentation task slice, the relevant technical context, and the summary of any prior worker output.
- **Scope**: repository documentation only — README, CHANGELOG, in-repo `/docs`, and the documentation site target named in the task. Never touch product code, tests, or infrastructure.
- **Procedure**: follow the `tsh-writing-documentation` skill workflow end to end, including its documentation-build validation expectations.
- **Escalation**: if the task cannot be completed without a product-code change or unresolved ambiguity, stop and report the dependency instead of working around it.
- **Plan synchronization**: when working from a `*.plan.md` file, update the delegated scope's progress and Definition of Done checkboxes, and record any approved deviation in the plan's Changelog section.

## Output Format

Return a concise response containing the list of files created or modified, a one-line summary per file, the verification you performed (including whether the docs build passed when applicable), and any open dependency or ambiguity you could not resolve within the documentation scope.
